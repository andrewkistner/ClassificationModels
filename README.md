# Machine Learning Classification Models

## Description

Using a dataset from Kaggle, classification machine learning models were constructed to make a prediction if an animal at a shelter will be adopted. Data cleaning techniques and reducing categorical data was introduced to reduce the amount of noise in the final models. The models constructed for this datasets were Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Support Machine Vectors (SVM).
